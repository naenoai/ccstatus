# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`showFolder` setting**: Controls the workspace folder segment, honoured both on the main status line and on the "Claude Code not installed" fallback path

### Changed
- **Workspace identity hidden by default** (breaking): `showFolder` defaults to `false` and `showGitBranch` now defaults to `false`, down from `true`. VS Code already shows the folder in the title bar, Explorer, and window title, and ships an SCM status bar item for the branch. The default status line is now model, tokens, context bar, and rate limits — session state only. Both segments remain one setting away for anyone who wants them back.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- **OAuth API Support**: Direct API integration with `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` for fetching fresh rate limits
- **Three-Tier Data Pipeline**: Prioritized data sources (rate-cache → OAuth API → stale cache) for improved reliability
- **OAuth Credentials Support**: Reads OAuth tokens from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` for API authentication
- **API Caching**: 60-second in-memory cache for OAuth API requests to minimize redundant calls
- **Enhanced Session Detection**: Improved logic to detect new Claude Code sessions based on transcript timestamps
- **Better Context Estimation**: More accurate context percentage calculation from cumulative token usage

### Improved
- **Data Source Fallback Chain**: Gracefully falls back from live cache to OAuth API to stale cache
- **Diagnostics Command**: Added OAuth API connectivity test to debug output
- **Error Handling**: Better error handling for missing or invalid credentials
- **Code Organization**: Refactored for better maintainability and performance

### Fixed
- **Model Extraction**: Enhanced `.model.id` fallback for edge cases where display_name is unavailable
- **Timestamp Handling**: Improved Unix timestamp parsing for countdown calculations
- **New Session Detection**: More accurate detection when transcript is created after last cache update
